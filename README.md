Role to install and bootstrap nodejs

## Getting started
This role runs by default with a single sqlite database which is not recommended it should be updated with a more prodcution ready database.

## Advanced

There are numerous other options within the [defaults/main.yml](./defaults/main.yml) that can change other parts of the behavior of the system

## Changelog
The [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) is stored externally
